Common types of fish used for sashimi include salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and halibut. After selecting the fish, rinse it with cold water, pat it dry with paper towels, and place it on a bed of ice to keep it cold and fresh. Then, use a sharp knife to slice the fish into thin, even slices, about 1/4 inch thick and 2-3 inches long. Make sure to cut against the grain of the fish to ensure the slices are tender. Arrange the slices of fish on a sashimi platter or a plate, leaving space between each slice. Finally, serve the sashimi with soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger on the side. To eat, dip a slice of fish into the soy sauce, add a small amount of wasabi if desired, and eat it with a piece of pickled ginger.",

First, make sure your knife is sharp as it will make it easier to slice the fish thinly and evenly. Additionally, use a clean cutting board to prevent cross-contamination during preparation. It's also important to keep the fish cold to maintain its freshness and safety. While salmon, tuna, yellowtail, and halibut are popular types of fish used for sashimi, feel free to experiment with other types of fish and seafood, such as scallops, squid, or octopus. By following these steps, you'll be able to create delicious and fresh sashimi right in your own kitchen. Enjoy!"
